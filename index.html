        <h1>Development of an AI-Supported Physiotherapy Tracking Assistant for the Rehabilitation of Osteoarthritis Patients; Knee-Hip Joint Example</h1>

    <main>
        <p> With the rapidly increasing global aging population, chronic diseases such as Osteoarthritis (OA), which affect 70% of the elderly, are on the rise. A literature review identified a lack of studies that enable knee and hip OA patients to perform accurate physiotherapy (PT) independently of location and share treatment outcomes with their therapists. The purpose of this project is to improve the quality of life for OA patients, allowing them to be independent of time and place. The project aims to make PT more accessible, safe, and effective by developing an AI-supported mobile platform. This platform detects and analyzes patients' postures during PT using Google's machine learning algorithm-based Pose Detection API. The application, developed using the Google ML Kit Pose Detection API, compatible with mobile devices, detects the key points of the human body. Classes capable of drawing a skeleton on the screen were then created using these key points. To assess the accuracy of the patient's posture during exercise, the angles between joints and the relative position of key points were used. The angles between the joints were calculated using the 'atan2' function. The necessary conditions for evaluating the accuracy of the patient's posture during exercise were determined with the help of expert physiotherapists, and algorithms for the mobile application were created. To enhance safety during PT, a fall detection algorithm was created using the body angle, and the data during exercises were recorded in a database to monitor and evaluate the treatment process. Thus, both therapists and patients can track the treatment process. Additionally, the mobile application associated with the project has been completed and optimized. Finally, a survey was conducted with a sample group of 6 expert physiotherapists, confirming that the application works correctly and is user-friendly.</p>
